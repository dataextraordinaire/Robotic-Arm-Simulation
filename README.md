# Robotic Arm Movement & Efficiency Simulator  
*Built by Chris Adam | Robotics Strategy + Simulation*

> A lightweight robotics simulation that models a 3-joint arm reaching for a 2D target using forward kinematics.  
> Simple enough to explain, powerful enough to demonstrate motion logic, risk evaluation, and control constraints.
